		<li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</h1></li>

		<p>Hi! I'm Miles Lee (they/them) and I'm a junior pursuing a BFA in Communication Design and minoring in Writing and Computer Science.</p>
		<br>


		<li>Tell me a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li>

		<p>I took a Web Development class in Summer 2016 and loved it (I've also taken Codecademy's HTML/CSS class). I took a class called <b>Visual Principles for the Screen</b> last semester that taughht me a lot about web design.
			<br><br>
		I'm taking this class because it's required and I couldn't fit the Computer Science department's Web Development course into my schedule, but I'm excited to get back into it.</p><br>


		<li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell me a bit about it.</li>

		<p>I coded a few 5-paged websites from scratch in my class using HTML/CSS but haven't learned JS.</p><br>


		<li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li>

		<p>I'd like to learn how to increase the functionality of a website such as creating 100% responsive pages, implementing smooth transitions, collapsable menu bars, and other effects.</p><br>


		<li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li>

		<p>I've designed for screens in Visual Principles for the Screen, but for this class I'll have to consider how feasible it actually is to create my website using HTML/CSS/JS while designing it (the limitations of the media and all that).</p><br>


		<li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li>

		<p>I enjoy the design of <a href="https://www.brandalmanac.com/">Almanac's website</a> because the information provided is easy to digest due to its placement on the page. The design elements (color, type, texture, placement) are supporting one another.</p><br>


		<li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li>

		<p>I think <a href="https://qlife.org.au/">Q Life's website</a> uses effective communication because it splits up information into digestable, easily distinguishable sections.</p><br>


		<li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li>

		<p><a href="https://destinationpride.org/">Destination Pride</a> not only looks good, it works well too. I like that the opening sequence quickly and effectively describes the use of the website while also reflecting its own content. I like the way it depicts information that can be hard to portray visually.</p><br>
