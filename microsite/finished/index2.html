		<p>Hilma af Klint (October 26, 1862 – October 21, 1944) was a Swedish artist and mystic whose paintings were among the first Western abstract art. A considerable body of her abstract work predates the first purely abstract compositions by Kandinsky. She belonged to a group called “The Five,” a circle of women who shared her belief in the importance of trying to make contact with the so-called “High Masters”—often by way of séances. Her paintings, which sometimes resemble diagrams, are a visual representation of her complex spiritual ideas.</p>
